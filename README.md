Hey folks, I have created a dashboard project , Sales Report using Power BI is an interactive business intelligence dashboard that provides key sales insights by analyzing data from a SQL database. The report highlights the Top 5 Customers and Top 5 Products, helping businesses identify their most valuable clients and best-selling items. It also includes Sales Quantity by Market and Revenue by Market to assess regional sales performance. Additionally, the report features Total Sales and Total Revenue metrics to measure overall business growth. Users can dynamically filter data using a Year Slicer (2017-2020) and a Month Slicer to analyze trends over time. By leveraging Power BI for visualization and SQL for data extraction, this project enables data-driven decision-making and enhances business strategy with insightful sales analysis.
